Rise and shine, Emma. Oh my god, it's a perfect 55 degrees morning in San Francisco.
Literally ideal running weather. You're gonna love this. The Presidio trails are looking
absolutely gorgeous today. Remember when you could barely finish three miles? Now you're crushing
eight-mile runs like it's no big deal. That's some serious level-up energy right there. Fun
science fact of the day, your muscles actually love these cool morning temps. It's like getting
a natural performance boost. Just don't forget your fuel stops every 30 minutes. I know, I know,
I sound like such a coach right now. Pro tip, those hills you've been training on, they're
basically your secret weapon for race day. Trust me, you're going to thank yourself when you're
zooming past everyone else. Keep being amazing. Every step is taking you closer to that finish line.
