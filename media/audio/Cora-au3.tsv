0	5940	Hey Jen, love seeing you claim this 545 sacred space. Remember when you thought meditation was
5940	11700	just another productivity hack? Now look at you, embracing these quiet moments like an old friend.
12080	17540	Today's insight. Watching the sunrise over the bay bridge this morning, noticed how the light
17540	23280	changes gradually? No rushing, no pushing, just natural unfolding. Kinda like your journey with
23280	28800	mindfulness, right? Leadership nugget. When that all hands gets intense today remember your pause
28800	33900	practice. That micro moment between stimulus and response where your best decisions live.
34120	38480	You're really owning that space now. Keep nurturing this practice Jen you're
38480	42060	redefining what conscious leadership looks like in tech one breath at a time.
