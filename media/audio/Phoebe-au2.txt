hey michael catching that golden hour at 6 15 in san francisco love to see that consistency
quick thought for today you know what's wild the whole work from anywhere revolution
has totally changed the fire game get this 87 percent of tech roles are now location flexible
pretty sweet for someone eyeing that 2035 freedom right here's what's got me excited i'm seeing more
and more folks in our community crushing their fire goals by thinking outside the bay area box
they're keeping those sweet tech salaries while exploring some seriously cool lifestyle options
food for thought where could your skills take you the world's getting smaller but the opportunities
they're exploding keep rocking that morning routine you're building something special here
